## Research Experiences

I want to express my gratitude to the professors at McGill who gave me incredible research opportunities and helped solidify my decision to pursue further studies. During my undergraduate years, my research focused on three main topics: random trees, differential privacy and Littlestone dimension, and modular forms.

### Directed Reading Program

During Winter 2025, as part of the Directed Reading Program, I was supervised by master’s student Tasmin Chu. We studied Markov Chains and Mixing Times by Levin and Peres for foundational material on Markov chains, and Probability on Trees and Networks by Lyons and Peres as the main text. A detailed schedule of our work is available [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasmin-chu/DRP+Mentorship) and our final report can be found [here](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/gsams/drp/PastYears.html) under the 2025 section, where the project is titled Probability on Trees and Networks.
### Random Trees

In the summer of 2024, I received the *NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA)* to work under Professor Louigi Addario-Berry’s supervision. I also received an *FRQ supplement* for this award. Together with two other students, I studied an algorithm designed to recover the root (or initial vertex) of a random tree grown via uniform attachment.

In this process, each new vertex is attached to an existing vertex chosen uniformly at random. The algorithm, introduced by Bubeck, Devroye, and Lugosi in *“Finding Adam in Random Growing Trees”*, selects a set of vertices whose size is independent of the tree size, ensuring the root is in the outputted set with the desired confidence level. Working with my colleagues, we determined the optimal number of candidates needed for the algorithm to achieve its goal. As a result, I co-authored a paper which is currently available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18614). This experience sparked my love for applied mathematics and probability and significantly influenced my goals for graduate studies.

### Differential Privacy and Littlestone Dimension

As part of a graduate course on mathematics for artificial intelligence, I explored differential privacy in the non-interactive setting. An algorithm achieves differential privacy when any individual's data has minimal influence on the results of a dataset query, thereby ensuring the protection of sensitive data. My project involved analyzing the article *“A Learning Theory Approach to Non-Interactive Database Privacy”* by Blum, Ligett, and Roth.

Building on this, I took a research course *(COMP 400)* under Professor Hamed Hatami, where I worked with another student to investigate the clique dimension of contradiction graphs for various concept classes. We aimed to improve the known upper bounds as a function of the Littlestone dimension. The Littlestone dimension is finite if and only if a concept class is approximately private learnable, meaning it can be PAC-learned by an approximately differentially private algorithm. This course allowed me to explore a topic in theoretical artificial intelligence, where the data dimensions were too large to allow realistic running times for any algorithm, making the use of advanced graph theory essential.

### Modular Forms

In the summer of 2023, I received the *Science Undergraduate Research Award (SURA)* and was supervised by Professor Patrick Allen. My project focused on finding counterexamples to a component of Serre’s Modularity Conjecture. Although this conjecture was disproved by Serre himself, it provides a framework for understanding which Galois representations correspond to modular forms under specific conditions, including level, weight, and Dirichlet character.

The issue of this result was the conjectured Dirichlet character. Collaborating with two other students, we developed an algorithm to identify modular forms that served as counterexamples by analyzing their Dirichlet characters. Using SageMath, a library designed for number theory, we used the data from the *L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB)*.
