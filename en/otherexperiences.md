## Other Experiences
### Service Work

During the last two years of my undergrad, I was involved with the *McGill Artificial Intelligence Society*, a club that’s very dear to me. AI is a complex field to master, but these days, it’s such an essential tool to have in anyone’s toolbox. This club provides a welcoming space for beginners to dive deeper into the topic and learn more about its importance as a key research area in both academia and industry.

In my first year, I worked as VP Events, and I had the opportunity to organize two big events: *MAIS Hacks* and the *Learnathon*. *MAIS Hacks* was a 48-hour hackathon with 150 participants, where the challenge was to create a project involving AI. We had mentorship and workshops available for everyone, and I worked closely with industry sponsors to make sure everything ran smoothly. The *Learnathon*, on the other hand, was a series of conferences on AI and ML, where we brought in leading researchers, including Yoshua Bengio.

This year, I started off on the podcast team, reaching out to AI leaders in both industry and academia to plan interviews for our podcast. By the end of the fall semester, I returned to the Events team to help make the 2025 hackathon a success.

### Work Experience 

I worked part-time at a hardware store throughout most of my undergrad, which taught me a lot about time management, as I had to balance my job with my studies.
