My name is Catherine Fontaine and I finished my Honours Mathematics and Computer Science degree at McGill and starting a master’s in mathematics this september! 

I’m particularly drawn to the intersection of mathematics and computer science, with a focus on probability theory. As an undergrad, I explored this through graduate-level courses and became especially interested in stochastic processes, like random graph processes. My research will focus on randomly growing graph in the superliner preferential attachment model. 

### Publications

[*Optimal root recovery for uniform attachment trees and d-regular growing trees*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18614) joint work with Louigi Addario-Berry, Simone Têtu, Robin Khanfir and Louis-Roy Langevin. Preprint on ArXiv.

**Abstract:** We consider root-finding algorithms for random rooted trees grown by uniform attachment. Given an unlabeled copy of the tree and a target accuracy $\varepsilon > 0$, such an algorithm outputs a set of nodes that contains the root with probability at least $1−\varepsilon$. We prove that, for the optimal algorithm, an output set of size $\exp(O(\log^{1/2}(1/\varepsilon)))$ suffices; this bound is sharp and answers a question of Bubeck, Devroye and Lugosi (2017). We prove similar bounds for random regular trees that grow by uniform attachment, strengthening a result of Khim and Loh (2017).
