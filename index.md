My name is Catherine Fontaine and I use she/her and they/them pronouns. I’m finishing my Honours Mathematics and Computer Science degree at McGill and planning to dive into a master’s in mathematics next year! After doing a bootcamp in machine learning by the McGill Artificial Intelligence Society, I became interested in applying probabilistic methods to create efficient algorithms. 

I’m particularly drawn to the intersection of mathematics and computer science, with a focus on probability theory. As an undergrad, I explored this through graduate-level courses and became especially interested in stochastic processes, like random graph processes. This summer, I did a summer research on root-finding algorithms for uniformly attached trees and attended the CRM-PIMS Summer School in Probability at Université de Montréal, where I learned about Bienaymé trees. Auditing a graduate course on the topic and attending quite a few time the CRM-ISM probability seminar  inFall 2024 confirmed what I already suspected: this is where I want to focus my research!

### Publications

Optimal root recovery for uniform attachment trees and d-regular growing trees joint work with Louigi Addario-Berry, Simone Têtu, Robin Khanfir and Louis-Roy Langevin.

Abstract: We consider root-finding algorithms for random rooted trees grown by uniform attachment. Given an unlabeled copy of the tree and a target accuracy ε>0, such an algorithm outputs a set of nodes that contains the root with probability at least 1−ε. We prove that, for the optimal algorithm, an output set of size exp(O(log1/2(1/ε))) suffices; this bound is sharp and answers a question of Bubeck, Devroye and Lugosi (2017). We prove similar bounds for random regular trees that grow by uniform attachment, strengthening a result of Khim and Loh (2017).
